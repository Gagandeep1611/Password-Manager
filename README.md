# Password Manager by Gagandeep Singh

## Description

**Password Manager** is a tool designed to securely store all your passwords in one place. It uses multiple layers of security to ensure that your passwords are encrypted and protected. Each user is provided with a personalized encryption key, which is crucial for accessing their stored passwords. If you lose this key, you won't be able to access your passwords, and neither can anyone else without the key.

The main problem this tool addresses is the common practice of using the same password across multiple platforms, which puts users at risk of cyber attacks. With Password Manager, you can generate and store multiple, complex passwords without the need to remember themâ€”just make sure to keep your encryption key secure.

## Installation

To access Password Manager, simply visit our website at `{websiteUrl}` and create an account. Registration and verification are required to use the service.

## Usage

After verification, you will receive a **10-digit encryption key** via email. This key is the only thing you'll need to securely access your stored passwords. Future logins require your password and an OTP sent to your email. The encryption key will not be visible in your Password Manager account, so it's important to save it offline and delete the email containing the key.
